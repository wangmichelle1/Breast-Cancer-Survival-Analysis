# Breast-Cancer-Survival-Analysis
I aim to predict breast cancer survival in years by using breast cancer patient data from the Netherlands Cancer Institute(NKI). The predictor works by identifying various physiological features and their relation to patient survival. I made various models including k-nearest neighbors, random forest, PCA, and multiple regression to better predict survival. My goal is to make models that allow cancer patients to predict their survival in years given their personal input values such as age, grade, and protein expression. The best model, multiple regression, is the best in predicting survival given the all the protein expression levels. Regardless, all the models should not be used to actually predict survival as they all represent bad or very weak relationship between the x-variables and y-variable.
